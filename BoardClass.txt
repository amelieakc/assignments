	Board Class 


	The board class should take in a vector of ships. There should also be member data and functions for the following:
int member which stores the number of ships on the board
int member which stores the size of the board 
size of the board → getSize()
the number of ships on the board → numShips()
how many ships have sunk → numSunk()
keep track of the total shots that miss their target → numMissed() 
whether the user has won or lost → gameOutcome()
how many points the user has → getUserPoints()
how many shots the user has taken per round/game → numShots()
